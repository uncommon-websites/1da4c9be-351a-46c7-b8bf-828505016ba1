    "prompt": "A professional office environment bathed in warm natural light, featuring a diverse group of people engaged in thoughtful collaboration around a wooden table. The workspace has subtle pops of teal and coral accents, natural wood textures, and lived-in details like coffee cups, plants, and notebooks. The scene is composed with editorial depth: medium-wide shot, gentle shadows, and layered environmental storytelling. Expressions are relaxed, engaged, and optimistic.
